# Getting Started with Create React App

To run this project locally on your machine, please follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Copy and paste the following command, then execute it to install the required dependencies:

```
npm i react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 react-scripts@5.0.1 web-vitals@2.1.4
```

## Available Scripts

Once the installation is complete, you can utilize the following scripts by executing the respective commands in your terminal window while within the project directory:

### `npm start`

This command will initiate the development server and run the application in development mode. Upon execution, you can access the application by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred web browser. Please note that the page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command will launch the test runner in an interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, please refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section of the Create React App documentation.

### `npm run build`

This command will build the application for production and generate a optimized and minified bundle in the `build` folder. The filenames in the bundle will include hashes for caching purposes. Once the build process is complete, your application will be ready for deployment. For more information on deployment, please refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section of the Create React App documentation.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can execute the `eject` command at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work as intended, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them as needed. At this point, you will be responsible for managing and maintaining these configurations independently.

You are not required to use the `eject` feature. The curated feature set provided by Create React App is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature unless you have specific customization requirements that cannot be met by the default configuration.
